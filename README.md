# LCA_2021Visualization
Shows average income and number of cases filed from each state for the Labor Certification Application

This was originally a csv file, downloaded from Kaggle. I used Excel to clean the data, and then went through the visualization process in Tableau Public.

Data shows the number of LCA cases filed by different companies in different states. A visualization of where most cases are filed alongside how the average wage of the individuals across states can be seen in the file.
